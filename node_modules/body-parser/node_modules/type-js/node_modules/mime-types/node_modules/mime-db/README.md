NPM Version NPM Downloads Node.js Version Build Status Coverage Status

This is a database of all mime types. It consists of a single, public JSON file and does not include any logic, allowing it to remain as un-opinionated as possible with an API. It aggregates data from the following sources:

http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types
http://hg.nginx.org/nginx/raw-file/default/conf/mime.types
Installation
npm install mime-db
Database Download
If you're crazy enough to use this in the browser, you can just grab the JSON file using RawGit. It is recommended to replace master with a release tag as the JSON format may change in the future.

Usage
var db = require('mime-db');

// grab data on .js files
var data = db['application/javascript'];
Data Structure
The JSON file is a map lookup for lowercased mime types. Each mime type has the following properties:

.source - where the mime type is defined. If not set, it's probably a custom media type.
apache - Apache common media types
iana - IANA-defined media types
nginx - nginx media types
.extensions[] - known extensions associated with this mime type.
.compressible - whether a file of this type can be gzipped.
.charset - the default charset associated with this type, if any.
If unknown, every property could be undefined.

Contributing
To edit the database, only make PRs against src/custom.json or src/custom-suffix.json.

To update the build, run npm run build.

Adding Custom Media Types
The best way to get new media types included in this library is to register them with the IANA. The community registration procedure is outlined in RFC 6838 section 5. Types registered with the IANA are automatically pulled into this library.
